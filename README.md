# Palindrome Checker using Stack (C++)

This project is a **simple Palindrome Checker** implemented using **C++**, **Stack (STL)**, and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
It checks whether a given word reads the same **forward and backward**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main objectives of this project are:
- To understand the **stack data structure**
- To apply **OOP principles** in C++
- To check palindrome strings using stack logic
- To practice character-by-character comparison

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Stack Data Structure (STL `stack`)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Member Functions
- String traversal
- LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
- Input/Output operations (`cin`, `cout`)

---

## 🧾 Program Description

- The program defines a **PalindromeChecker** class
- All characters of the input string are pushed into a stack
- The string is traversed again and compared with stack elements
- If all characters match, the string is declared a **Palindrome**
- Otherwise, it is **Not Palindrome**

---

## 🧩 Class Structure

### Class: `PalindromeChecker`

**Member Function**
- `bool isPalindrome(string s)`  
  Checks whether the given string is a palindrome using a stack
